# Routing Algorithm

## Overview

I have implemented the Clarke and Wright Savings Algorithm to solve the given problem. My motivation to do so is as follows.

While observing the layout of Netherlands and its major cities on Google Maps, I noticed some patterns that are also applicable in the UAE (an environment that I am familiar with):

* [The road infrastructure is one of the best in the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/road-quality-by-country)
* Major cities have small land areas and are fairly densely populated

[Along with that, the population per major city is rather low](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cities/netherlands)

| Amsterdam | Rotterdam | The Hague |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 741,636   | 598,199   | 474,292   |

Inferring from the above assumptions, letâ€™s also assume that traveling between neighborhoods is fairly fast on average and within neighborhoods, you could typically carry out 1-3 delivery/pickup events while parking in one spot and walking to the final destinations.

These assumptions have allowed me to conclude that **on average, a given route will contain a few neighborhoods which will be easy to travel between and the number of deliveries per neighborhood will typically be low** [due to the low overall population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).

Drawing from this, the route calculation should not be a resource intensive task which allows us to use a heuristic VRP approximation algorithm with confidence.

## Clarke and Wright Savings Algorithm

The Clarke and Wright Savings Algorithm produced above average results in almost every iteration and the results were consistent across the iterations as well. In contrast, some other heuristic algorithms such as two-opt neither produced consistent nor usable results.

After seeing positive results with the Clarke and Wright algorithm, I researched on alternatives to find a more optimal solution but my research led me to believe that this is indeed the best option for the reasons stated below:

* The savings calculation allows for more constraints to be added, therefore the algorithm is flexible. So even if my above assumptions are not entirely correct, I am hopeful that I can add on to this algorithm to make it fit the actual problem space
* The algorithm can be mapped to real world routing constraints such as capacity, fuel consumption, shift timings, pickups etc
* The algorithm has a fast computation time
* The algorithm consistently produces good approximations

Algorithm Steps:

1. Start with the assumption that each delivery/pickup event is one route (depot -> delivery/pickup -> depot)
2. Calculate the savings (in terms of travel duration) achieved when each pair of routes are combined
3. Starting with the highest saving, check if merging the two routes is allowed:
   1. The total vehicle volume used does not exceed the vehicle capacity
   2. There is only one pickup in the merged route
4. If allowed, merge the two routes and continue
5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 until all the savings are considered and no more routes can be merged together in the specified constraints

## Running the Algorithm

To run the algorithm, simply run the src/run.py file. Results will be printed and a kml file will be generated in the result directory. This kml file is used to visualize the results on Google Maps.

To run the test, run python3 -m pytest (or pytest) in the root directory.
